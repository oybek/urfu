Machine Learning

Machine learning involves giving computers the capacity to learn, develop, and p
erform increasingly complex tasks on their own. This ability has applications in
 a wide array of fields, including health care, finance, consumer technology, ed
ucation, resources, and government. Machine Learning Engineers create algorithms
 for self-driving cars, foreign language translation, retrieving and processing 
data from social networks, and processing and reviewing customer data. In our Ma
chine Learning Engineer Nanodegree, you develop a skillset that you can apply to
 a wide variety of careers.
